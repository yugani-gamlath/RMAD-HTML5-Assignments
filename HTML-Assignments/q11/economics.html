            Economics is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption 
            of goods and services. It studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make
            choices about how to allocate resources. Economics focuses on the actions of human beings, 
            based on assumptions that humans act with rational behavior, seeking the most optimal level 
            of benefit or utility. The building blocks of economics are the studies of labor and trade.
            Since there are many possible applications of human labor and many different ways to acquire
            resources, it is the task of economics to determine which methods yield the best results.
            Economics can generally be broken down into macroeconomics, which concentrates on the behavior 
            of the economy as a whole, and microeconomics, which focuses on individual people and businesses.
