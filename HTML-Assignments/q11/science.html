            The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 
            1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek 
            natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations 
            of events in the physical world based on natural causes. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, 
            knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries 
            (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages,[7] but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden. 
            The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 
            13th century revived "natural philosophy",[7][9] which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution 
            that began in the 16th century[10] as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and 
            traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 
            19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape;
            along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science."
