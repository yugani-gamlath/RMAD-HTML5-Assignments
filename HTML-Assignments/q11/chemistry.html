            Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a natural science that 
            covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their 
            composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other 
            substances. In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and 
            biology. It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both 
            basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level. For example, chemistry explains aspects 
            of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and 
            how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), 
            how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).Chemistry 
            addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds. 
            There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one 
            or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce 
            ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g. hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals 
            force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc.
