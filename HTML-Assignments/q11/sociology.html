            Sociology increases the understanding and power of social action. Sociology studies the 
            role of social institutions (home, school, church and more) in the development of the
            individuals. Sociology provides critical insight and perspective to the solution of 
            social problems.Sociology focuses on the systematic understanding of social interaction, 
            social organization, social institutions, and social change. ... By making vivid the social
            basis of everyday life, sociology also develops critical thinking by revealing the social 
            structures and processes that shape diverse forms of human life.Sociology is the systematic 
            study of society and social interaction. In order to carry out their studies, sociologists 
            identify cultural patterns and social forces and determine how they affect individuals and groups.
