        Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers,
        computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design,
        development, and application.

        Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks,
        security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming
        languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.

        Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the
        field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer
        hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining
        what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the
        tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold
        security measures.

        Graduates of University of Maryland’s Computer Science Department are lifetime learners; they are able to adapt
        quickly with this challenging field.
