            Mathematics is the abstract study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, 
            and change. ... Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, 
            calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects.
            Mathematics provides an effective way of building mental discipline and encourages logical 
            reasoning and mental rigor. In addition, mathematical knowledge plays a crucial role in 
            understanding the contents of other school subjects such as science, social studies, and even 
            music and art.Mathematics makes our life orderly and prevents chaos. Certain qualities that are 
            nurtured by mathematics are power of reasoning, creativity, abstract or spatial thinking, critical 
            thinking, problem-solving ability and even effective communication skills.
