            Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and 
            behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of 
            the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe 
            behaves. Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, 
            perhaps the oldest. Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain 
            branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in 
            the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.
            Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum 
            chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain 
            the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in academic 
            disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy. Advances in physics often enable advances in new 
            technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, 
            and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed 
            modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in 
            thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the 
            development of calculus.
