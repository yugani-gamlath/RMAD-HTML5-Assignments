        <h1><mark>Faculty of Applied Sciences</mark></h1>

        <p>The Faculty of Applied Sciences was established on 01st October 1999 with the establishment of the Wayamba
            University of Sri Lanka as one of its four faculties. It was a transformation of the then Faculty of Applied
            Sciences I of the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka into a fully-fledged Faculty.At present, four academic
            Departments are functioning under the Faculty:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Department of Computing & Information Systems</li>
            <li>Department of Electronics</li>
            <li>Department of Industrial Management</li>
            <li>Department of Mathematical Sciences</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Departments offer course modules in the subject areas of Computer Science, Electronics, Industrial
            Management, and Mathematics, Mathematical Modelling & Statistics, respectively, for the following Degree
            Programmes.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>B.Sc. (General) Degree (3 years)</li>
            <li>B.Sc. (Joint Major) Degree (4 years)</li>
            <li>B.Sc. (Special) Degree in Applied Electronics</li>
            <li>B.Sc. (Special) Degree in Computer Science</li>
            <li>B.Sc. (Special) Degree in Industrial Management</li>
            <li>B.Sc. (Special) Degree in Mathematics with Statistics</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Students from the Advanced Level Physical Science Stream are admitted to follow these degree programmes.
            There
            are three subject combinations comprising of three subjects, to choose from at the beginning of the first
            year.
            The students will continue on these paths for two years until they are selected for Joint Major or Special
            Degree programs based on their performance at the first two years.

            The Joint Major Degree Programme, where students major in two subjects, have a six-months full-time
            industrial
            training and a final year project that provide opportunities for students to experience the industrial
            environment and to master the soft skills sought by the employers. The special degree programs have been
            designed to train the students to take up careers especially in the academic and research fields.

            All the Degree Programmes are conducted in English medium. There is a significant practical component
            involved
            in every programme, especially with the subjects of Computer Science and Electronics, and sufficient
            laboratory
            facilities are available to give the students the required hands-on experience.

            Undergraduates have the opportunity to publish and present the results of their projects at the annual
            Research
            Symposia of the Faculty. Each Department has a studentsâ€™ Academic Society through which the students can
            perform
            various co-curricular activities.

            The degree programs and the subjects offered by the Faculty being more practical based and industry
            oriented,
            the graduates of the Faculty have recorded higher employability rates. Our graduates are well employed in
            positions ranging from middle level upwards in education, banking, management, technology and other fields
            in
            the industry and services sectors.

            The Faculty continues to enrich its programmes in response to developments in the field of higher education
            and
            industry needs. We strive to equip our undergraduates with knowledge, skills and right attitudes to face the
            challenges in the wider world or work.</p>
