    <P>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript. </P>

    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
