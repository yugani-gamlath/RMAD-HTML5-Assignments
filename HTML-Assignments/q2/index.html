    <p>The Department of <big>Computing & Information Systems</big> contributes to the academic programme of the
        <sup>Faculty of Applied
            Sciences</sup> by offering Computing and Information Systems (CMIS) as a major subject for the B.Sc.
        (General) Degree
        and the B.Sc. (Joint Major) Degree programmes which fulfills industry needs. From year 2017, they extended their
        service by offering a <small>B.Sc. (Special) Degree in computer science</small> to cater to the current needs of
        the industry
        as well as to ensure a path towards academia.
    </p>

    <p>Presently, the Department offers more than twenty course modules including projects and industrial training.
        Courses range from introductory level to advanced and high demanding course modules coupled with practical
        components covering all essential areas for an undergraduate computer science degree.

        Students are provided opportunities to gain theoretical knowledge in the major areas of Computer science and
        acquire practical competence in computer programming, gain hands on experience in using different operating
        systems and varied software including open source software, and to develop transferable skills; thus laying a
        firm in IT for career opportunities and for higher studies.

        The Department of Computing & Information Systems was established as one of the four Departments of the Faculty
        of Applied Sciences when the Wayamba University was established in 1999, by transforming the then Department of
        Industrial Management & Computer Studies of the Wayamba Campus of the Rajarata university into two Departments.

        Today the Department is functioning on its own resources, and contributes to the academic programmes of the
        Faculty by offering above mentioned degrees. As of this year, the Department has seven permanent lecturers and
        three computer laboratories with 110 networked computers to conduct practical classes and examinations. Measures
        are also underway to expand the laboratory facilities to meet requirements of the increased student intakes as
        well as introduce new external and internal study programs.</p>

    <p>
        <ins>Vision of the Department</ins>
    </p>

    <p>
        To be a leading higher education institute in Sri Lanka recognized for its outstanding Computer Science
        programmes, innovative research, scholarship and outreach with the ultimate target of serving the mankind.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ins>Mission of the Department</ins>
    </p>

    <p>
        To develop highly qualified and responsible citizens who contribute to the improvement of society and
        sustainable development of the country through Computer Science.</p>

    <h2><strike>Undagraduates</strike></h2>

    <p>Presently, the Department offers <del>26 course modules</del> including a <strike>project,</strike> aggregating
        to 82 credits. The courses
        range from introductory level to advanced modules. The Department also offers three course modules (12 credits)
        as optional module with computer based projects for level III students for students not majoring in CMIS. There
        has been a high demand recording more than 80% of the students being enrolled to follow course modules offered
        by the department.</p>

    <h2><strike>Postgraduates</strike></h2>

    <tel>The department currently able to offers Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) and Doctor of Science (Ph.D.) degrees.
        The department and the academic staff are engaged in latest research activities in the field of computer
        science.</tel>

    <p><mark>Association of Computing & Information Systems Students (ACISS)</mark> is the studentâ€™s society of the
        Department of
        Computing & Information Systems which was established in 2006. It provides a knowledge-sharing platform for
        theory, practice, and application of computer science and information technology. The ACISS aims to provide
        inspiration and collaboration in computing and Information Systems in the University premises. ACISS
        successfully organizes the activities such as coding competitions, seminars, and recreational events. Our goal
        here is to create a professional graduate who is armed with complete knowledge in computing & Information
        systems.</p>
