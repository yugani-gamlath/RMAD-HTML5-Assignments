        Also an awesome structure in the Galle Dutch Fort sites, the Dutch Reformed Church narrates yarns from centuries
        ago. You will be able to take a stroll into history if you hire a guide who can pace you around with relating
        incidents. The door of this church belongs to the work of an 18th-century craftsman. This church which is
        otherwise called Groot Church embraces a lot of graves on the floor while the pulpit was created using Malaysian
        Wood.
