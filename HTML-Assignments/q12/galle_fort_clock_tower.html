    <p>
        The Galle Fort Clock Tower was built as a dedication to the Humanitarian Doctor Peter Daniel Anthonisz who was
        known for being quite a people-person. The record has it, the people living in Galle pitched in to have enough
        money to build this tower in the Galle Fort Campus.

        This Clock Tower has a remarkable history to it, which a local guide will love to narrate to you during your
        visit to the Galle Fort. The structure overlooks the once guardâ€™s room which was called Moon Bastion.
