        Nestled in the premise of the Galle Dutch Fort, the Galle Lighthouse is an imperial beauty. The captivating
        architecture, tall building and the breeze it echoes are all unforgettable scenes that even a camera cannot
        capture at its best. One can see the far-off oceans that face the lighthouse, which is factually the oldest one
        in the country. It was a sigh of relief for ancient mariners and is a scintillating sight for tourists today.
