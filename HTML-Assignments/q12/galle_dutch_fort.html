        Built several years ago on a massive piece of land in Galle, the Galle Dutch Fort was used by the Portuguese
        until the Dutch took over it. The British finally sealed the fort as theirs with a lot of re-building and
        renovation. The unique blends that led to the standing of this monumental structure are now listed under the
        UNESCO World Heritage Sites thus deserving a substantial place on the list of places to visit in Galle.The 
        area is so beautiful, that is a favourite amongst couples for a pre-wedding shoot.
