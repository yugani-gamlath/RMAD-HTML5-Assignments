        The Old Gate is yet another remains of the British from their times in Galle. On one outside area of the Galle
        Fort is this Old Gate which is an arty carving of a coat of arms tops. There are two sculptures of lions that
        border in-between which the letters VOC is inscribed which stands for Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie. The year
        1699 is also etched on this patch to mark the year of its making.
