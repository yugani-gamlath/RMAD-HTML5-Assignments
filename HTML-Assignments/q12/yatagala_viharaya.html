    <p>
        Also known as the Mani Chethiya or Yattalaya in some old scriptures, the Yatala Raja Maha Viharaya is an ancient
        Buddhist Stupa bordered by sculptures of elephant heads. One can revisit the olden times in the museum that is
        built near the Pagoda that gives an in-depth tale of the structure.

        You can also spot a statue of the Buddha, which is one of the very few remains that this place covers. The Lotus
        Pond attracts many children to play around them.
