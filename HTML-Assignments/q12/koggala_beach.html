        Amongst the many beaches in Sri Lanka, Koggala Beach has become a secret favourite for the tourists owing to
        this coastlineâ€™s spectacular view. Not only is it a great place to unwind and rejuvenate as you listen to the
        waves hug the sand every few seconds, but it is also a fun place to get some surfing lessons, and walk to the
        Koggala Lake.

        The beach is so beautiful, that many prefer staying at one of the beach hotels or resorts. You should try your
        hands on some local delicacies when you take a break from relaxing!
