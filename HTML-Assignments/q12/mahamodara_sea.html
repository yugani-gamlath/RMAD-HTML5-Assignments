        The Mahamodara Sea Turtle Hatchery Galle is a revolutionary concept where volunteers work towards the
        conservation of Sea Turtles who are sure to reach extinction if not taken care of. If you visit this place, you
        will find a lot of sea turtles of all sizes being cared for and left in their natural habitat by keeping their
        area clean of garbage to help them hatch and grow their babies. It is a very edifying visit, and yet a very cute
        one as well.
