        Rumassala Sanctuary is one of those places to visit in Galle that takes you back on an epic journey of the tale
        of the Ramayana. It is told that Hanumana dropped his mountain somewhere here during the episode when Princess
        Sita is kidnapped. This sanctuary grows several herbal and medicinal plants.

        You will also spot quite many species of birds if you have an eye for it. This panoramic hilltop was once used
        to transport valuable stones and spices to ships and other travellers.
