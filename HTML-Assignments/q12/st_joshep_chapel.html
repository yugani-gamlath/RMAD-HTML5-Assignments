        This tiny chapel has absorbed in every wall ounce of serenity to impart to visitors looking for inner peace. St.
        Joseph’s Chapel is a depiction of the Roman Catholics from the Portuguese times, which was later revived by the
        Dutch. You will observe a tint of Dutch architectural style in this quaint chapel. Spending some quality along
        time inside this holy building attracts a lot of peace.
