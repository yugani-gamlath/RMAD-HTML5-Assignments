        A beach with golden sand that complements the clear ocean waves is surely one of the places to visit in Galle
        during your trip. Lying in the southern region of Sri Lanka, Unawatuna Beach is one of the most famous spots
        amongst tourists for swimming, walking and relaxing.

        One can also rent some sunbeds to take the day off from the world and just lay still as you oversee the vast
        sea. This beach is surrounded by a lot of eateries that surely put a fine cap on a well-spent day. Canoeing is a
        great pastime on this beach.
